he also meant relinquishing physical possessions The point is to get rid of everything now he said in his trademark mileaminute clip Youve got to figure out who gets what or not And the last step in

hope it continues to stick with me as I get older It reminded me of an interview in  on the NPR program Fresh Air where the host was interviewing the New Yorker cartoonist Roz Chast about a book she had recently written on dealing with her aging parents last years In the interview Chast mentions something along similar lines as Scorsese does here Apparently her parents rarely threw anything away and as an only child she eventually had to deal with the sorting dispersement andor disposal of their possessions and the associated emotional impact At one point she mentions it caused her to reflect about her own life A friend who had recently been in a similar situation tells her if you dont think your children will be interested dont keep it She talks about how this raised her conscious on these matters and to think of her own possessions postmortemistically Its a terrific podcast on a topic most of us must deal with at some point and like this piece can help us reflect on these matters

Martin Scorsese made between Marvel films and high cinema up till now but was taken a bit aback when he said he didnt need to see Joker because he saw clips of it knew what it was and it was fine Joker is a huge film that was made with a great deal of craft with amazing performances by Joaquin Phoenix and his friend Robert DeNiro I worked on it for a few weeks so I saw this I also worked on the Irishman and saw the love and craft with that film He may think he knows Iron Man  but he doesnt know Joker without seeing it', 'Matthew Benson I strongly believe that if Martin Scorsese did see

it and watched it in two takes While I am front and center when it comes to complaining about the dearth of good womens roles cant complain about Scorsese He makes films about the mob and mobsters virtually uniformly are men They use women for decoration and to show off their manliness And Irishman illustrates the consequences of that kind of life view In the end his characters are withered and diminished men Their lives meant nothing even to themselves', 'Ill keep this on a different not necessarily better or more important level than what is discussed in the article and so far what Ive found in a chunk of these commentsFirst off The Irishman is great  A very rich and interesting and thought provoking experience  And entertaining  Always entertaining  You never have to worry about that with MartyBut secondly folks if you havent or even if you have please see his films Last Temptation of Christ Kundun Silence After Hours King of Comedy Alice Doesnt Live Here Anymore The Age Of Innocence   They seem to never be quite as referenced as his other legendary works but holy cow theyre terrific or in a case or two if not terrific really interesting   And I will throw out serious

the stories of the gangsters that populated his young world As a child I also was swept up in and in awe of those characters Their violence was not on the surface They were seen as friendly men giving quarters to the kids in the neighborhood and driving around in big cars They wore shiny shoes and fancy suits and were very different from our working class dads When I see Scorseses films I see these neighborhood criminal characters come to life once more Maybe you have to have come from that milieu to really understand where Scorsese is coming from I never feel that he glamorizes the violence of his characters and he always shows the emptiness of  their lives We didnt see that as kids But Marty shows it to us now in his films and makes us feel lucky that we were just bystanders', 'Ms Pea Your

times in my life the screen would go blank because something was wrong with the projectorAt the same time home systems were getting quite nice  I had a computer geek roommate and the distance from the comfy clean couch to the big screen was the same ratio as being in a theater  We could sit in our pajamas smoke bowl after bowl and drink a beer watching a film and best of all any time I felt like I missed a clue I could pause back up see what I missed and continue  I cant imagine ever going back to a movie theater for any reason at this point  People would more than likely sit in front of me with their phones in the air trying to film it for their YouTube channelI have no attention span problem  I think nothing of binge watching some old scifi like Farscape in a week watching  hours at a sitting  And the best thing about watching a film at home  Ill cry if I want to and not be embarrassed  Men arent supposed to cry at movies  As for art form  I studied filmmaking in college then went

Goodfellas  I wont argue too hard about that one but its a personal preferenceSure art  I mean thats been the topic of film making in Scorceses wheelhouse right  How somehow Marvel movies arent that and cinema is  Thats fine as an opinion but as a movie viewer I beg to differ  Art is as they say in the eye of the beholder  Theres an art to making a movie with a studio to be enjoyed by the masses

societies he portrays where women are marginalized  As is also the case in our larger society for all of known human history  For womens stories to be told we need to look to other directors

which is now a crime because you know other girls feel bad about themselves  Thats real history as told from the perspective of gangsters  Its absurd that his work has to be put through a metoo meat grinder  His work wasnt about women  Or politics  Or nature Or whatever  What is pitiful is that he feels pressure from you to apologize for his creative output because you just got on the woke wagon

caliber of The Irishmanare few and far between and require a good amount of searching on just the right subject to ferret them outSo please Mr Scorsese dont stop now just because you are   you will

that people still remember and watch but obscure pieces of American movie history that he thinks should also be preserved and valued If you ever hear him speak on the subject his encyclopedic knowledge about these films is staggering Sadly this kind of attention to our countrys valuable cultural history is rare  and it shows in the increasing shallowness of American films Most moviemakers

stories he is capable of telling based on his own aesthetic and perspective and he has done that in many of his films Yes this perspective is limited as is every individual artists but those mens stories are the ones he is telling and effectively so and the solution is not to pressure Scorsese into including women but rather to have more female Scorseses emerge in the future and be given

hidden Paquins character carries that heavy burden and the toll it takes on her is a particular cost that she alone bears For example the characters attraction to Hoffa illustrates her search for a father figure she can trust Since we know who Hoffa actually is it illustrates just how vulnerable her family history has made her Paquins honest performance is beautiful heartbreaking and devastating

about how she became a woman who was forced to reject her family in the way it was done in those days A problem we have lately is that characters from the past are judged by todays woke standard and found wanting', 'An inspiration in a variety of ways Keep em coming', 'I love many of Scorceses films but my favorite one may be The Age of Innocence where both Michelle Pfeiffer and Winona Ryder play incredibly complex powerful women who seem like delicate flowers in the constrained society of upper class s New York City One scene between Pfeiffer and Daniel DayLewis in a snowy country house on the Hudson has relatively little dialogue and absolutely no skin you see the two characters briefly hug but its incredibly sexy and powerful You feel their yearning and angst and not just what is occurring between them but what they deeply repress Only a directorial talent like Scorcese can pull that off Beautiful', 'Sorka Thanks for reminding me of this film  I often think of the banquet  the masses of food such as fresh salmon on ice  That film was a master piece of the ability of people to make masterpieces which are temporary the feast the banquet or the gala', 'Philip Montgomerys black

from their hands and the expressions they reveal', 'Loved this article because it made me wonder where I was in this process of living being creative and eventually sailing away For the exact reason Mr Scorsese expressed were all going is something to consider when making choices of how to spend your time I am very glad with how Ive spent my time when watching one of his films The Irishman was a great film to see in the theater Praise to Netflix for seeing it got made', 'This piece would have been a lot stronger if it had included quotes from Anna Pacquin Sharon Stone and other women who have worked with Scorsese instead of just having the director and one of his employees speak for them', 'kndtate Anna Paquin featured in much of The Irishman spoke but one line according to my tally  He does not give women as actors in his films their due with perhaps the exception of Lorraine Bracco as Karen Hill  Stone as a drugged out prostitute is not my idea of a woman to watch in a film  But lets face it  Too many directors dont do right by women because Im guessing they simply dont understand them', 'HIs best movie was Hugo which I believe he made at the request of a granddaughter Out of the three heroic people in the movie two are women', 'jjh I dont know if Hugo was Scorseses best movie but I know noone else could have made it  His love of cinema and his Italian romanticism shaped every frame of that film', 'So glad to read this piece Glad for his movies  I wish him luck in the future', 'So Scorsese is a fan of Jean Cocteau Cocteaus artistry in film appeared generally whimsical

conscious  aware somewhere below me of the turmoil of the crash but uninterested marveling that I was not there but identifying as consciousness itself  I told the neurologist who examined me that afternoon that I was not unconscious before ambulance workers started removing me from the wreckage  He told me I most certainly was  From then on Ive had no doubts about life after death but surety that we are as Sri Aurobindo has reported consciousness not life and form  I dont know if my thread of disinterested awareness of my body in the crash was an anchor connecting me to life as we know it

character is fairly sparse in what she says as child the point being to illustrate the seeds of the divide between her and her father So it makes perfect sense that she says nothing with her mouth and everything with her eyes and facial expression as an adult Those complaining about this being a female part with no dialogue are pushing an agenda and missing the artistry and drama of what Ms Paquin delivers in her performance', 'If you are lucky enough you get to make the films that you want to makeYou dont have to make the films other people want you to makeThey can make their own', 'Martin Scorsese deserves recognition as a highly influential director Each movie however has to stand on its own credentials and storytelling The Irishman bored me with its excessive length focus on men being the only half of the population that apparently has fullfledged emotional lives which is laughable considering our culture usually creates the opposite effect and its use of a fantasy team of actors  all roughly Scorseses age  to play men  years younger for most the movie The women rendered all but voiceless at lease were cast closer to their appropriate ages so they could look decent in their swimming suits of course The whole thing washed me in the same sadness of watching my grandfather grow old unaware of his own loss of authority or influence because of the the charade those who loved him kept up Buoying the fragile egos of men past their prime', 'In Gangs of New York Scorsese depicted the violence by setting up the stabbing then panning the camera away so that the audience got to see a bystander reaction instead of the knife and the body of the victim It doesnt make the movie less violent its actually more horrifying Sheerans daughter Peggy is treated the same way We never see her reject her father instead we see Sheerans despair Its one of his other daughters who explains to him what he did to bring her rejection on Peggy has zero character development because Scorsese isnt going to dilute his picture just to give us a rich female character Hes interested in making the audience feel Sheerans agony at his daughters judgement There are other films in which the male characters are there to serve the narrative of a central female figure perhaps not enough but there are and its a mistake to ask a storyteller to dilute a story to pander to a public sense of social justice', 'The Irishman was visually bizarre two septuagenarians digitally plasterfaced with portly body kinetics that resemble decrepit dinosaurs playing young fellas When Joe Pesci called Robert Deniro kid I thought Is this a comedy Sadly it is not', 'What I learned from The Irishman is that a man can make the same kind of movie over and over again and people will still come to watch it even if stretches over three hoursWhat I learned from The Age of Innocence is that a man can interpret a sublime novel in a heartfelt and insightful way that is still with me all these years later', 'I wonder how many more male filmmakers would be making serious movies that include great female roles if the issue wasnt so fraught  If Scorsese is seen as misogynist after the female

tedious bore replowing the same soil that Scorsese has exhausted of any creative or stimulating nutrients And Pacinos performance Was there any scenery left unchewedThe problem with using a stock company performing stock material is that you end up with a tired unimaginative and repetitive formula Mr Scorsese is churning the same product ad nauseam Whats the pointThere is a provincialism and lack of curiosity to a lot of his gangster movies but his latest efforts strongly suggest an exhaustion of imagination Albeit his audience never tires of mumbled threats and spattered blood I do not

they are so effective  This experience is helping young budding filmmakers in ways they dont even realize yet  I think Dolemite Is My Name is going to be one of those films that draw audience back again and again because of how skillfully  and subtly  it is constructed  It couldnt be more different from The Irishman which also begs multiple viewings again because of the subtle skill of the filmmaker  Netflix is a game changer in ways we dont even know yet', 'Chrislav And for those of us who really cant afford theater prices Netflix is great to see And for those of us who really cant

something up not seeing films on the big screen properly presented  Few people especially those living in a city like New York have an appropriate screening environment at home  And it boggles the mind that young people are willing to watch movies and TV shows on a  screen   And theres also a big difference watching a film with a huge audienceI sincerely believe that one of the reasons the recent Star Wars films have faced so much criticism is because back in the day we watched the original Star Wars with a thousand other people and that provided a completely different experience Watching a film like Scorseses Mean Streets with  other people was incredible because all of us saw something we had never seen before together  Would we still think highly of Lawrence of Arabia today

months later I went to the movies  in my upper west side neighborhood to see a small unknown film called Mean Streets I almost fell out of my seat when I saw the fight scene on th Street where DiNiro beats up the guy on the hood of a parked car I have been waiting for almost  years to run into Scorsese so he can thank me for not walking into the scene and ruining it For my money NOBODY in the

glamorize violence either', 'As women characters in The Irishman go Kathrine Narducci got my attention as Joe Pescis partner and enabler', 'Mobsters are terrorists  Ive never understood their

of friends and business associates that share his heritageI even spent several years living in Sicily back in the s Yet nowhere have I encountered the rampant dishonesty and ruthless behaviors endlessly depicted in those filmsGranted such activities happen at some time or place within all cultures But as Mr Scorsese ponders his closing days perhaps its time also to close the book on these wellworn themes And that includes recasting them onto other nationalities', 'Misterbianco  I disagree  They speak of what they know where they came from what they heard When a good Russian English

portrayal and that might be of any lasting artistic value then the fact is that they are going to be top heavy with men who constantly display a particular kind of toxic masculinity These gangs were after all run by men and populated by menFor me none of that makes Scorseses attitude to women in any way questionableIf Greta Gerwig for example made a mid twentieth century gangster movie then it would be about men too and the fact that you write about men in such a milieu says nothing about your attitude to womenThere is a movie waiting to be made maybe a novel waiting to be written about the women involved with such men but it would be a different kind of movie and Scorsese doesnt have to carry that ballIt should never have to be said but the artist is separate from hisher subject matter

undefinable essentially human and vital Is it loss after all Is that what we all inevitably share especially as we near the end of our own short take on the stage of life Even lives of great joy must

wave of emotion going from rage to gravelvoiced intimate conversation I liked the slow fateful march of death towards Hoffas fateful removal with Hoffas hubris preventing him from seeing the grim reaper at his back But the whole premise of the film that a savvy street fighter like Hoffa would draw into his inner circle a known enforcer of a Mafia Don whose interests would inevitably clash with

grateful', 'As a novelist childrens book author screenwriter and playwright I found the Irishman markedly different from Scorseses other gangster films  The difference is subtle but important What is different in this picture is that Scorsese positions DeNiro literally and figuratively so that he is repeatedly forced to either conceal or reveal the characters thoughts and reflections about painting houses orand here is what people seem to missthe lack of internal conflict As an exadjunct sociology professor and exprosecutor I find the question of what goes through a persons headand heartwhen they do the unspeakable things I have seen and heard  tapes videotaped confessions allocutions to present the single most important question there is As a playwright and director I find the decision of whether to overtly portray or merely gesture at a despicable characters internal life is the key to a believable engaging performanceand its an incredibly difficult balance  To have adjusted the Irishman to reveal what the assassin was thinking and feeling until Scorsese choses to do thatnear the end of the filmand to do so with a greater degree of earnestness and openness than DeNiros character was capable of would not have rung true  As for the subject of approaching death and how that changes ones perspective Scorsese was limited by DeNiros character and the storyline

Scorsese may be considered by some to be a great filmmaker I agree with others that his consistent stereotypical portraits of women are insulting and aggravating  As for his repeated excursions into

ignoring him Every artist reflects his own life into what he creates Scorsese is an  yearold ItalianAmerican raised in Little Italy If you dont object to him pulling from his young lifes influences when he depicts Italian men as murderers and mobsters then you arent being intellectually honest when you object that he pulls from that same experience and that same time and place when it comes to women Creatively when youre developing a female character that would marry one of these guys youre not thinking about someone who wouldnt be in that world As the FBI agent tells Lorraine Braccos

that  But boy every mile of that drive was worth it to see this movie Id been waiting  years for  And so I dont get harangued now because of the gas carbon use I offset my carbon footprint when I got

about the week prior  special screening at the Castro with Marty talking about the film', 'I know the time and the place in which Scorsese grew up and I understand his lifelong obsession with telling the stories of the gangsters that populated his young world As a child I also was swept up in and in awe of those characters Their violence was not on the surface They were seen as friendly men giving quarters to the kids in the neighborhood and driving around in big cars They wore shiny shoes and fancy suits and were very different from our working class dads When I see Scorseses films I see these neighborhood criminal characters come to life once more Maybe you have to have come from that milieu to really understand where Scorsese is coming from I never feel that he glamorizes the violence of his characters and he always shows the emptiness of  their lives We didnt see that as kids But Marty shows it to us now in his films and makes us feel lucky that we were just bystanders', 'Ms Pea Your

times in my life the screen would go blank because something was wrong with the projectorAt the same time home systems were getting quite nice  I had a computer geek roommate and the distance from the comfy clean couch to the big screen was the same ratio as being in a theater  We could sit in our pajamas smoke bowl after bowl and drink a beer watching a film and best of all any time I felt like I missed a clue I could pause back up see what I missed and continue  I cant imagine ever going back to a movie theater for any reason at this point  People would more than likely sit in front of me with their phones in the air trying to film it for their YouTube channelI have no attention span problem  I think nothing of binge watching some old scifi like Farscape in a week watching  hours at a

societies he portrays where women are marginalized  As is also the case in our larger society for all of known human history  For womens stories to be told we need to look to other directors

question how did women fit into gangs  They were peripheral and they nagged about the mens behavior and they were long suffering and kept the home fires burning and yes gangsters had hot girlfriends which is now a crime because you know other girls feel bad about themselves  Thats real history as told from the perspective of gangsters  Its absurd that his work has to be put through a metoo meat grinder  His work wasnt about women  Or politics  Or nature Or whatever  What is pitiful is that he feels pressure from you to apologize for his creative output because you just got on the woke wagon

that people still remember and watch but obscure pieces of American movie history that he thinks should also be preserved and valued If you ever hear him speak on the subject his encyclopedic knowledge about these films is staggering Sadly this kind of attention to our countrys valuable cultural history is rare  and it shows in the increasing shallowness of American films Most moviemakers

stories he is capable of telling based on his own aesthetic and perspective and he has done that in many of his films Yes this perspective is limited as is every individual artists but those mens stories are the ones he is telling and effectively so and the solution is not to pressure Scorsese into including women but rather to have more female Scorseses emerge in the future and be given

that honored the concept by providing movie entertainment that portrayed human experience in all its variety Not for him the fantastical worlds inhabited by super heroes but the panorama offered by a reality based world in all its dimension What the movie world needs is more Scorsese more like him to carry on that tradition of movie artistry', 'Many of the comments urge Mr Scorsese to move on from the genre andor depict women in a more favorable current light Some comments made a point to say that they hadnt watched The Irishman due to it being the same old same I have to disagree with all of the above He has honed his craft so beautifully through the years knows his subject matter so well that this is his niche and nobody does it better You dont go into a Chinese restaurant and ask for lasagna Just like you dont see a Scorsese film expecting Marvel CGI or fresh Greta Gerwig dialogue from a female lead I for one was totally bummed that I couldnt see The Irishman on the big screen because the film is visually stunning and I wouldve liked to have seen it on something besides my tv And if you havent watched the film you shouldnt call it the same old same Its really notThis piece

alone They have probably been around longer than you have', 'Corrie Um find space where the trees have already been cut down', 'I sensed that Scorsese was reflecting on his own mortality in the final

Scorseses films also fall into its what it is', 'I loved this film and am a devoted fan of ScorseseAl Pacino should win the academy award for best actor in this film   I disagree with those who say that the film was too long  It wasriveting and a walk throughAmerican history from politicsincluding the Kennedys to power and control to the music which consists of a fourth importantdimension of the film as well as the relationships historically  among the Italians the Irish the Mob the unions and political power and greedThe added dimension of the newtechnology to change the appearance of age for actorsis amazing and revolutionary Thank you to Netflix for supporting the making of this film  I watched it twice andgoogled questions about American history the second time seeing it  Can not recommend it highly enough', 'Very good interview Scorsese has certainly left his mark and The Irishman has prompted me to read the source book I Heard you Paint Houses to both understand Frank and how life can lead to his behaviors as well as to have a complete separate view of past history and bigger than life events I think all Scorseses movies bring forward these perspectives which leads to a lot of reflection  Certainly there is also a need to reflect on ones life as one starts ones senior years which is supported by the movie as well as the interview following the movie something never available in the theater', 'Scorsese tells stories  No Disneylike action figures  No Marvel comiclike figures  Just great stories that unfold in an exciting and captivating way  His portrayals of mob

watch it again  I wish him a long and healthy life and I look forward to Killers of the Flower Moon', 'I certainly appreciate the incredible beauty style and innovation of Scorseses work But as many others have stated there is an uncomfortable lack of fleshed out powerful women in his films and very few people of color Certainly none in significant roles And now hes making a film about Native Americans starring Leonardo DiCaprio', 'Linda It seems unlikely DiCaprio is going to portray a Native American If you are familiar with the book you would know that in addition to Osage protagonists there are also a number of significant nonnative roles In fact some of the most significant Osage characters are women It will be interesting to see who is cast DiCaprio seems perfect for one of the Texas Rangers who helps solve the crime', 'Linda Mr Scorsese delineates a refined appreciation for historical and social context The primary value of this article is Mr Scorseses sharing his thoughtful views on approaching mortality', 'Linda Pocahontas wasnt available or she would be in it because she would have been a great audience draw as well', 'renata Didnt think hed be portraying a

to great effect', 'Seriously Did you really just compare treatment of women in films to painting flowers Yes I get that you probably didnt mean that literally but it shows the complete obliviousness

They dont appear to have independent agency and exist as anything other than a reflection of the men or to provide plot elements to the men They are there but solely as backgroundWhether or not you agree with that assessment its ridiculous to dismiss it with your analogy of a painters choice of subject Theyre not even remotely analogous', 'Eric Gersh Karen Hill is an adornment Sharon Stone in Casino Pfeiffer or Ryder in Age of Innocence Scorcese movies are entertaining and interesting Are we now going to insist that all movies no matter how entertaining must have a particular development of certain type of characters or else be considered misogynistic or racist Im well more concerned with Scorceses support of Polanski then the characters in his films', 'RR So by your logic no artist can ever be criticized in any fashion for making art that excludes marginalizes or sidelines women and other underrepresented groups  Pretty convenient way to perpetuate the status quo indefinitely No

you saying that Scorcese supports that child rapist Polanski  I wish Scorcese had made a movie about Polanski and what makes him and others tick  We really dont need another gangster movie but we do need an explanation for pedophilesCan they be cured', 'Eric Gersh  Whats analogous is that people like you  or me  have no business telling other artists what to do A plot may give minorities in this

just saw Casino on k since it was a Christmas gift Folks not only had I not seen it the year it premiered revisiting it made so much more sense I love Martin for creating Sharon Stones character from a mold all too familiar for some of us I loved how Marin gave us the pleasure to watch the manipulation unfold so quietly until it explodes on scene Its sad because Ive know people like this over the years and the character Stone portrays only seem to multiply in society as if its fashionable to act like that these days whens it not I found her character so much more interesting than in Basic Instinct', 'When I first saw Taxi Driver years ago I was simply shattered by the violence and terrible carnage in the film Nonetheless I have never forgotten this film and Ive watched it several times since for different reasons not least of which is the use of music written by Bernard Herrmann And of course to speak of women in his films one cannot forget the very young Jodie Fosters remarkable performance in this movieIve seen several Marvel movies with my grandchildren but I can never remember what they were about One tends to remember great films or even simply remarkable ones if the

about the tie time boundary and while curiosity persists resolution remains  elusive   No help here', 'Its also a world worth leaving and not getting any better Its such a heavy word death Think No longer angry or depressed or in pain or confused Just doneI look now at small children and realize they will live in the time of Earths dying and the suffering the frantic and horrible sufferingand my

say it was fun Bob', 'Anna Paquins role in The Irishman was powerful and spoke volumes with little dialogue I am the daughter of a Cleveland union leader circa late ss In many respects it was like watching my own Irish American father and my relationship to him Paquins role in the family was like mine Witness to the unspoken truth that the adults refused to acknowledge and acted as if it was hidden Paquins character carries that heavy burden and the toll it takes on her is a particular cost that she alone bears For example the characters attraction to Hoffa illustrates her search for a father figure she can trust Since we know who Hoffa actually is it illustrates just how vulnerable her family history has made her Paquins honest performance is beautiful heartbreaking and devastating Ultimately I found it liberating because the truth sets us free and that character is  true Thank you Martin Scorsese Anna Paquin and everyone who made The Irishman I look forward to many more films from Scorsese And lastly not for nothing dont sweat Netflix I watched The Irishman in one uninterrupted sitting and Im sure many millions did so and will continue to do so', 'Kathleen I agree  Paquins character appears only briefly in the movie but her presence her judgement is felt as we witness all of Franks actions throughout', 'Kathleen I totally agree and opine that Anna Paquins performance was the most outstanding in the movie She resembled a character with Cassavettes exquisite touch and the deep meaningful acting of Gena Rowlands I do wish that Mr Scorsese would amplify this talent at direction and leave the violence behind And thank you to the reader who reminded of The Age Of Innocence with its internal dark violation of trust redemption and quiet humanity Perhaps Scorsese and Pacino will give us an American LearOne can hope', 'Kathleen   shes not a character shes a plot device', 'Kathleen I agree Paquin and the young actor who played her character as a child said a lot about how she became a woman who was forced to reject her family in the way it was done in those days A problem we have lately is that characters from the past are judged by todays woke standard and found wanting', 'An inspiration in a variety of ways Keep em coming', 'I love many of Scorceses films but my favorite one may be The Age of Innocence where both Michelle Pfeiffer and Winona Ryder play incredibly complex powerful women who seem like delicate flowers in the constrained society of upper class s New York City One scene between Pfeiffer and Daniel DayLewis in a snowy country house on the Hudson has relatively little dialogue and absolutely no skin you see the two characters briefly hug but its incredibly sexy and powerful You feel their yearning and angst and not just what is occurring between them but what they deeply repress Only a directorial talent like Scorcese can pull that off Beautiful', 'Sorka Thanks for reminding me of this film  I often think of the banquet  the masses of food such as fresh salmon on ice  That film was a master piece of the ability of people to make masterpieces which are temporary the feast the banquet or the gala', 'Philip Montgomerys black

from their hands and the expressions they reveal', 'Loved this article because it made me wonder where I was in this process of living being creative and eventually sailing away For the exact reason Mr Scorsese expressed were all going is something to consider when making choices of how to spend your time I am very glad with how Ive spent my time when watching one of his films The Irishman was a great film to see in the theater Praise to Netflix for seeing it got made', 'This piece would have been a lot stronger if it had included quotes from Anna Pacquin Sharon Stone and other women who have worked with Scorsese instead of just having the director and one of his employees speak for them', 'kndtate Anna Paquin featured in much of The Irishman spoke but one line according to my tally  He does not give women as actors in his films their due with perhaps the exception of Lorraine Bracco as Karen Hill  Stone as a drugged out prostitute is not my idea of a woman to watch in a film  But lets face it  Too many directors dont do right by women because Im guessing they simply dont understand them', 'HIs best movie was Hugo which I believe he made at the request of a granddaughter Out of the three heroic people in the movie two are women', 'jjh I dont know if Hugo was Scorseses best movie but I know noone else could have made it  His love of cinema and his Italian romanticism shaped every frame of that film', 'So glad to read this piece Glad for his movies  I wish him luck in the future', 'So Scorsese is a fan of Jean Cocteau Cocteaus artistry in film appeared generally whimsical

conscious  aware somewhere below me of the turmoil of the crash but uninterested marveling that I was not there but identifying as consciousness itself  I told the neurologist who examined me that afternoon that I was not unconscious before ambulance workers started removing me from the wreckage  He told me I most certainly was  From then on Ive had no doubts about life after death but surety that we are as Sri Aurobindo has reported consciousness not life and form  I dont know if my thread of disinterested awareness of my body in the crash was an anchor connecting me to life as we know it

character is fairly sparse in what she says as child the point being to illustrate the seeds of the divide between her and her father So it makes perfect sense that she says nothing with her mouth and everything with her eyes and facial expression as an adult Those complaining about this being a female part with no dialogue are pushing an agenda and missing the artistry and drama of what Ms Paquin delivers in her performance', 'If you are lucky enough you get to make the films that you want to makeYou dont have to make the films other people want you to makeThey can make their own', 'Martin Scorsese deserves recognition as a highly influential director Each movie however has to stand on its own credentials and storytelling The Irishman bored me with its excessive length focus on men being the only half of the population that apparently has fullfledged emotional lives which is laughable considering our culture usually creates the opposite effect and its use of a fantasy team of actors  all roughly Scorseses age  to play men  years younger for most the movie The women rendered all but voiceless at lease were cast closer to their appropriate ages so they could look decent in their swimming suits of course The whole thing washed me in the same sadness of watching my grandfather grow old unaware of his own loss of authority or influence because of the the charade those who loved him kept up Buoying the fragile egos of men past their prime', 'In Gangs of New York Scorsese depicted the violence by setting up the stabbing then panning the camera away so that the audience got to see a bystander reaction instead of the knife and the body of the victim It doesnt make the movie less violent its actually more horrifying Sheerans daughter Peggy is treated the same way We never see her reject her father instead we see Sheerans despair Its one of his other daughters who explains to him what he did to bring her rejection on Peggy has zero character development because Scorsese isnt going to dilute his picture just to give us a rich female character Hes interested in making the audience feel Sheerans agony at his daughters judgement There are other films in which the male characters are there to serve the narrative of a central female figure perhaps not enough but there are and its a mistake to ask a storyteller to dilute a story to pander to a public sense of social justice', 'The Irishman was visually bizarre two septuagenarians digitally plasterfaced with portly body kinetics that resemble decrepit dinosaurs playing young fellas When Joe Pesci called

later', 'I wonder how many more male filmmakers would be making serious movies that include great female roles if the issue wasnt so fraught  If Scorsese is seen as misogynist after the female

tedious bore replowing the same soil that Scorsese has exhausted of any creative or stimulating nutrients And Pacinos performance Was there any scenery left unchewedThe problem with using a stock company performing stock material is that you end up with a tired unimaginative and repetitive formula Mr Scorsese is churning the same product ad nauseam Whats the pointThere is a provincialism and lack of curiosity to a lot of his gangster movies but his latest efforts strongly suggest an exhaustion of imagination Albeit his audience never tires of mumbled threats and spattered blood I do not

they are so effective  This experience is helping young budding filmmakers in ways they dont even realize yet  I think Dolemite Is My Name is going to be one of those films that draw audience back

mind that young people are willing to watch movies and TV shows on a  screen   And theres also a big difference watching a film with a huge audienceI sincerely believe that one of the reasons the recent Star Wars films have faced so much criticism is because back in the day we watched the original Star Wars with a thousand other people and that provided a completely different experience Watching a film like Scorseses Mean Streets with  other people was incredible because all of us saw something we had never seen before together  Would we still think highly of Lawrence of Arabia today

would be about men too and the fact that you write about men in such a milieu says nothing about your attitude to womenThere is a movie waiting to be made maybe a novel waiting to be written about the women involved with such men but it would be a different kind of movie and Scorsese doesnt have to carry that ballIt should never have to be said but the artist is separate from hisher subject matter

forgotten likes of Joseph Mankiewicz Don Siegel  Robert Siodmak Albert Lewin and  Joseph Lewis not to mention the threadbare brilliance behind  Sam Fuller and Edgar Ulmer productions who equaled and in many cases surpassed the solidly  budgeted work of media darling Marty', ' Kat MHow do you know either objectively or even subjectively that the movie is too long', 'I didnt finish the movie

Administrationand Boxcar Bertha', 'I admire Scorsese as a filmmaker and consider him to be one of the countrys best I think The Irishman is a wellconstructed if overlong and wellacted film However I do wish Scorsese would finally just steer clear of making these films that focus on these Mafia characters As an American of Italian descent it is for me comparable to watching a blackface minstrel show I grew up in a community largely composed of people of Italian descent and nobody talked like these characters and nobody acted in any way shape or form like these characters I know better and I know a lot of other people know better but there are also a lot of stupid people out there who dont Scorsese certainly knows better Come on Martin give it a rest Use your talents to tell other stories ones that do not malign your own people', 'Yeah Bob Iger is a great source of integrity', 'A great director supremely knowledgeable about all things cinema but whose films in the last  years has been largely retreads of his great early successes He has relished showing us the sick brutalites of criminal life contributing to the trashy and nihilist excesses of modern popular film Why on earth would a wouldbe humanist filmmake make junk like The Wolf of Wall Street', 'Dear Mr Scorsese when you meet Bob Iger please ask him why he would not save the National Geographic Your Shot website I am afraid I know the answer already it earned Disney no money And that is what Disney has become a money chaser', 'This criticism of Scorseses movies as using a stereotypical depiction of female characters is just another example of our politically correct nonsense operating in American cinema today and elsewhere  This is similar to Jon Meacham a respected American historian announcing the other night on CNN that America has made only minimal progress on race relations  Really  What America is he talking about  Thats just another example of an appeal to a liberal audience so Meacham can sell his book', 'Gert In the entertainment industry and related fields both minorities and women have made tremendous progress  Just look at the credits at the end of any television show and think back to the eighties and even the early nineties  forget about the decades before then   Problem is in the Real World the power and wealth remain where theyve always been  Thats the way it is', 'The Irishman took more than a decade to make and as its cast grew to include Harvey Keitel Pesci and Pacino who had never worked with Scorsese the director could feel the stakes getting higherIm confused by this

male macho exercise  women are not a part of it  Can we get over that', 'styleman  as Emma Tillinger Koskoff said in this article Scorsese has created many very strong and memorable female characters My favorite is Karen Hill in Goodfellas and the other female characters in this film Its one of my favorite movies Ive seen it many times and hope to see it again for many more times In fact I think Ill see it now I am very disappointed that Mr Scorsese never made the film Id read he was going to make of the novel The Devil in the White City by Erik Larson I know that instead of being a film Mr Scorsese has made it into a TV series which I for one cant see', 'Dave this is a wonderful article', 'It has been clear from the beginning that there are movies and then there is cinema  In the early parts of a mans career they get into the zone and are all in it Then as they continue to work that zone becomes more elusive  The perfect moments when everyone on the set is in sync are spread out both by the projects and within themWe care about each others work  With sharp knives we cut out of our lives those things not worth caring so we can care', 'Mr Scorsese neednt worry about people

Hoffa on ice to see the unrealized power of having phantom limbs to carry out some very messy jobs', 'Scorsese reflecting onaccepting his mortality had special resonance after reading earlier today the latest NYT installment of the series on the very old', 'Scorsese is an American treasure Read the cast lists and the crew and do a male to female ratio  Then count how many lines the women have

This is a woman professor of literature and cinema writing Silence both in films and in literature can often speak louder than words', 'menexplainthingsme I thought the silence of Paquins character was one of the most affecting and compelling aspects of the movie Her body language and facial expressions were devastatingly effective and conveyed all that needed to be conveyed What dialogue could possibly have been spoken that would have been louder and more revealing than her thundering silence Words would have destroyed the effect And yes more female directors are much needed but youre discounting the possibility that a female director could very well have treated the character in the same silent way as Scorsese Isnt the golden rule to show not tell', 'menexplainthingsme    Sure we do desperately need more female directors and all other voices in society to find funding to direct and express themselves within the medium of film Please though dont slag a filmmaker and talk about malefemale character ratios as any sort of measure of success or worthiness', 'Nellie McClung not every film needs an equal maletofemale ratio to be good just and insightful Yes many of Scorseses films are told predominantly from a male perspective but thats because those are the stories hes drawn to much of the time Doesnt make them any less valuable  Go watch Alice Doesnt Live Here Anymore or Casino Or even Taxi Driver Cybil Shepard and Jodie Fosters characters have great depth and humanity  Yes we need more women directors Maybe youll appreciate Scorsese producing Joanna Hoggs The

Scorsese', 'Alice Doesnt Live Here Anymore', 'menexplainthingsme I think hes one of our greatest directors ever If you dont like him as a director or the stories in his films thats fine Applying a gender ratio to his movies really misses the point If you look at the totality of his work youll find women characters treated with great humanity and respect', 'I have to comment on the Irishman I was confused when the Joe Pesci character called the De Niro character son De Niro looked as old as he is today To pull off the young to old most movies use  actors Not doing that here made the movie look contrived Not anywhere near Scorseses best work A somewhat boring movie Period', 'Would that the great directors of the early th century had worked into their seventies as well', 'Scorsese has made some great movies to be sure But Im afraid he loses me when decries that Marvel Movies are like Disneyland and bad for the movie business while he has no problem accepting  million to make a mob

only thing thats changed and is going to continue to change is the way movies are delivered to people to watchI dont need Mr Scorsese to criticise how or what movies I watch I just want him to keep making better movies', 'Martin Scorsese was the first film director I auditioned for having just moved to New York CityAfter the audition he mumbled something to De Niro they call him Bob who  was sitting next to him and then De Niro mumbled something back to Scorsese they call him Marty Scorsese  then gave me some acting adjustments so that I can do the audition over againAfter the nd take they were both more animated thistime but the mumbling continued as I tried to ease dropFinally I saidYou have an amazing command of the English Languagewhich caused them both to laugh out loud along

very down to earth without artifice or pretenseWhen I was walking home from the Rolex Bldg on th AvenueI thought to myselfWow My first film audition with two cinema legends I could not have been more grateful', 'As a novelist childrens book author screenwriter and playwright I found the Irishman markedly different from Scorseses other gangster films  The difference is subtle but important What is different in this picture is that Scorsese positions DeNiro literally and figuratively so that he is repeatedly forced to either conceal or reveal the characters thoughts and reflections about painting houses orand here is what people seem to missthe lack of internal conflict As an exadjunct sociology professor and exprosecutor I find the question of what goes through a persons headand heartwhen they do the unspeakable things I have seen and heard  tapes videotaped confessions allocutions to present the single most important question there is As a playwright and director I find the decision of whether to overtly portray or merely gesture at a despicable characters internal life is the key to a believable engaging performanceand its an incredibly difficult balance  To have adjusted the Irishman to reveal what the assassin was thinking and feeling until Scorsese choses to do thatnear the end of the filmand to do so with a greater degree of earnestness and openness than DeNiros character was capable of would not have rung true  As for the subject of approaching death and how that changes ones perspective Scorsese was limited by DeNiros character and the storyline  Thats easy to fix', 'Well said except for your last paragraph which is why Robert De Niro should be recognized for having turned in another jewel in his acting crown for one of the best performances of the year and one of his best in decades', 'no director in memory has had the ability to turn crime and its consequences into more compelling drama than Martin Scorsese  he is an American Treasure

for now stay well Marty I love you', 'laura wagner  no director in memory has had the ability to turn crime and its consequences into more compelling dramaEver heard of a guy named Coppola', 'While Scorsese may be considered by some to be a great filmmaker I agree with others that his consistent stereotypical portraits of women are insulting and aggravating  As for his repeated excursions into male violence  doing something well once or twice can be interesting but making a career of doing the same thing over and over  when the world around you is changing and other issues have come to the fore  is a waste of talent and money', 'Ahh but he has done other things marvelous things The King of Comedy After Hours Hugo The Aviator All top notch films Also he has made some of the most

Ive been a fan of Scorseses work for decades  I watched The Irishman alone critically and with deep appreciation for the large and small arts That tracking shot from that height What beautiful movement and how it makes me feel so much The gorgeous visual compositions of frames and scenes The performances as always total and engrossing The next day I pondered this film as itself and within the context of his body of work  Then I recalled scenes from Italianamerican  a documentary he made while  talking to his parents about their history and to his mother Catherine about how she made

to make every artist conform Who approved this scorecard of ratios and plot lines If Scorsese doesnt give female roles the right ingredient mix for you how about not crucifying the guy and just ignoring him Every artist reflects his own life into what he creates Scorsese is an  yearold ItalianAmerican raised in Little Italy If you dont object to him pulling from his young lifes influences when he depicts Italian men as murderers and mobsters then you arent being intellectually honest when you object that he pulls from that same experience and that same time and place when it comes to women Creatively when youre developing a female character that would marry one of these guys youre not thinking about someone who wouldnt be in that world As the FBI agent tells Lorraine Braccos character in Goodfellas theyre not lambs in the woods Its totally reasonable that the daughter of a man capable of killing her beloved uncle and his closest friend would do the only thing she wasnt frightened of doing in retaliation That is to take away her love from him and be silent She knew that would kill himMove onto other filmmakers And get over yourself', 'The reason for not watching the Irishman in one sitting isnt the length its the bloodbath  Such fine actors doing the youze guys thing and killing each other  Enough already  The movies Scorsese so admires never showed this stuff in

is watching Goodfellasand realizing he brought a wholly new energy to movies and seeing them as an art form for the first time He doesnt hit every one out of the park but when he does he reinvents
